I have 10000 Docker points. How much does it cost in INR?,Rewards & Recognition Policy,"Answer:
Based on the information provided, 400 Docker Points can be redeemed for INR 200. Therefore, to calculate the cost in INR for 10000 Docker points, you would divide 10000 by 400 to get the number of times the redemption value can be applied, and then multiply that by INR 200.     

10000 Docker Points / 400 Docker Points = 25
25 * INR 200 = INR 5000

Therefore, 10000 Docker Points would cost INR 5000.
